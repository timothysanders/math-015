# Chapter 1: Logic

## 1.1 Deductive versus Inductive Reasoning
### Problem Solving
- Logic and reasoning are associated with "problem solving" and "critical thinking"
- First step in solving any problem is to define the problem thoroughly and accurately
  - "What am I being asked to do?"
- After defining the problem, all known/relevant information must be gathered, organized, and analyzed
- Compare present problem to previous ones, how is it similar or different?
- Do not be afraid to try something different
#### Definitions
- `logic`: science of correct reasoning
- `reasoning`: drawing of inferences or conclusions from known or assumed facts

### Deductive Reasoning
- Inductive reasoning is using patterns
- Deductive reasoning is using a specific idea/example/assumption/principle
- Once a problem has been defined and analyzed, it may fall into a known category of problems
